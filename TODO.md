## Planned Features

### URL Support for Images
Currently, images must be stored locally in the `mods/presentation/<id>/` directory. To improve multiplayer compatibility, we plan to add support for loading images from URLs (e.g., Imgur, direct image links).

**Benefits:**
- Better multiplayer experience (no need to distribute image files manually)
- Easier image updates
- Reduced server storage requirements

**Implementation Status:** Not yet started
